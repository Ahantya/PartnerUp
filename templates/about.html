            <!-- faq answer -->
            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Last year, one of our founders was interested in finding a health-related internship for a class at school. This was a difficult but overall enlightening process, as one particular problem he encountered was finding companies to reach out to. With PartnerUp, we solve the problem of connecting students to bio companies to ease future students who are either taking the same class just interested in health, with finding an internship.</p>
